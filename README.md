# Ticket Machine

A ticket machine app where lecturers create a session and set a code which they then would let their student know, the student then connect to the session and clicks on the button to ask a question, which in return sends a notification to the lecturer that a student requires help. If a lecturer is not free then the student gets into a queue. After the session is finished the lecturer can see the statistics from the session and send them over the email. A project I built for my 2nd year iOS module.
